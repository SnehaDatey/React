CRUD operations in ReactJS involve Create, Read, Update, and Delete data, typically through a REST API. Here's a brief summary:

Setup: Install Axios (npm install axios) to handle HTTP requests. Configure a base URL if needed.

Create (POST): Use axios.post() to send data to the server. Bind form inputs to state and send the state as a payload.

Read (GET): Use axios.get() to fetch data from the API. Store the response in the component's state and display it in the UI.

Update (PUT/PATCH): Use axios.put() or axios.patch() to update existing data. Trigger the function on edit events and send updated data to the server.

Delete (DELETE): Use axios.delete() to remove data. Typically triggered by a delete button.

State Management: Use useState or a state management library (e.g., Redux) to manage data and re-render the UI dynamically.

Error Handling: Add catch blocks or error handlers to manage failed requests gracefully.

Example Flow:

Display a table with fetched data (Read).
Use a form to add new records (Create).
Edit a row to update details (Update).
Include a delete button for each row (Delete).
This approach integrates Axios for smoother HTTP request handling, making it a powerful tool for working with REST APIs in React.
