The project used a Product API to fetch product data, which was displayed dynamically using React components. Key features included product listing, a detailed product page, and an add-to-cart functionality. Axios was used for API integration, and React hooks like useState and useEffect managed state and side effects. The project demonstrated skills in responsive design, component-based architecture, and REST API integration.
