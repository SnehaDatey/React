In this project, I delved into the fundamentals of React by focusing on Props and integrating external data through APIs. Leveraging React's component-based architecture, I created a small application that effectively utilizes Props to pass data between components. Additionally, I incorporated API calls to fetch JSON data dynamically, enriching the application's content and functionality. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into managing component communication and integrating external data sources seamlessly within a React application.
