This repository showcases my journey of learning and applying ReactJS through various hands-on projects:

Explored CRUD operations with Axios for seamless data management.


Gemini AI Clone
Integrated external APIs using API keys to simulate an AI-based application

Movie Review App
Focused on mastering Props and API integration to display dynamic data and enhance interactivity.

Record-Keeping System
Utilized useState hooks to build a responsive user management system.
Created an interface for adding and deleting users without page reloads.


Each project reflects my growing expertise in ReactJS, including component-based architecture, state management, API integration, and building efficient, user-friendly interfaces.
